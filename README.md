# CS Unplugged Fonts

This repository contains the heading font used for the [CS Unplugged project](https://github.com/uccser/cs-unplugged).
The headings font is a modification of the [Sniglet font](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/sniglet) by [Haley Fiege](https://www.haleyfiege.fun/).
The font was modified to support Te Reo Māori.
The modification required the font to have a new name under the requirements of the [license](./LICENCE).

This repository is a fork of the original [Sniglet repository](https://github.com/theleagueof/sniglet), however this didn't include the new Regular font weight.
Therefore the modified font is based off the 2.0 version on [Google Font's repository](https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/ofl/sniglet).
